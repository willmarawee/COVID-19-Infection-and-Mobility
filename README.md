COVID-19 Infection and Mobility







Research Problem

Back in 2019, China made an announcement to the world of the new virus outbreak in Hubei province followed by the city shutdown. The virus was called Coronavirus. Later, the World Health Organization named the new strain of the contagious virus as COVID-19, Corona Virus Disease of 2019. Many people in the US, at the time, felt that China was overreacting to this pathogen since the world had already battled through several global pandemics such as SARS, Ebola, and major flu outbreak within the past couple of decades (Rogers, 2020).

In April 2020, US Governers in 43 out of 52 states have instituted quarantine restrictions in order to stop the spread of the virus. Thousands of Americans protested against the stay-at-home order that skyrocketed the unemployment rate in the US (Sorace, 2020). A business writer, Weiss (2020), stated that shutdowns cost the country trillions of dollars, and there is not much evidence that shutting down has had a significant impact on the total death of COVID-19. It raised the question “does the stay-at-home actually save lives?” 

In other words, “does the shut-down order has a significant impact on the COVID-19 infection rate?” 








Data Introduction

Public datasets will be retrieved from open sources such as GitHub, Kaggle, and Google Cloud. The project will require data insights on Community Mobility Report and COVID-19 Cases Report. Targeted Datasets are Google’s Community Mobility dataset, JHU’s COVID-19 Cases dataset, and USA Facts’ COVID-19 Cases dataset.

Google Community Mobility dataset reported a trend of changes in community movement in response to policies aimed at preventing the spread of COVID-19. The insight was tracked over the geography and community amenities by categories such as retail and recreation, groceries and pharmacies, parks, public transportation, workplaces, and residential areas (Google Health, 2020).

Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering’s COVID-19 Cases Real-Time report is a data repository for the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Visual Dashboard. The data covers global geography and the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries. It was developed to support the studies of the outbreak (JHU CSSE, 2020).

COVID-19 USA Facts is a dataset sourced from the CDC, and state and local health agencies. It covers US geography and the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths in the US. 








Methodology

On this data science project, the student will be collecting relevant data from public open sources such as GitHub, Kaggle, and Google Cloud. The collections of data will be merged into a single data frame with the use of Python codes and the Pandas library. The joint data will be explored, compared, and observed. 

The relationship between COVID infection and community mobility will be addressed with the employ of the Data Visualization tool like Tableau and Flourish. The overlay between the mobility in community and COVID-19 cases outbreak will be analyzed and lead to the conclusion of the research problem. 








Overcoming Challenges

Since data sets come from different sources, data format might be a problem when merging the data. To prevent the problem, we will clean the data and unitize the format prior to the data merge.

Key Jesuit Values 

This project will incorporate the mission of Contemplatives in Action. The student will display the philosophical thinking and take the action to address current social problems (Regis, 2020).
